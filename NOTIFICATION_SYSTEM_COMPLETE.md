# Notification System Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive notification system with 4 types of smart notifications for the Crowd app.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. ‚úÖ Firestore Security Rules
**File**: `firestore.rules`

Added permission for Cloud Functions to update notification cooldown fields:
```javascript
allow update: if request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
  .hasOnly(['notificationCooldowns', 'lastNotificationSent']);
```

### 2. ‚úÖ User Profile Model
**File**: `Crowd/Models/UserProfile.swift`

Added notification tracking fields:
- `notificationCooldowns: [String: Timestamp]?` - Map of notification types to timestamps
- `lastNotificationSent: Timestamp?` - Most recent notification timestamp

### 3. ‚úÖ Proximity Notifications (Enhanced)
**File**: `functions/index.js`

Enhanced existing `notifyNearbyUsers` function with:
- **3-hour cooldown** per user (10800 seconds)
- **Updated message format**: `"{Interest} Crowd has spawned nearby üìçüéâ"`
- **Interest emoji mapping** via `getInterestEmoji()` helper function
- **Dual matching**: Checks both user interests AND event tags
- **Cooldown tracking**: Updates user document after successful send
- **Dynamic filtering**: Only sends if user hasn't received notification in last 3 hours

**Key Features**:
- 400m radius filtering
- Interest + tag matching
- 3-hour cooldown enforcement
- Emoji-based interest display

### 4. ‚úÖ Engagement Notifications
**File**: `functions/index.js`

Created new `notifyPopularEvent` function:
- **Trigger**: When event reaches exactly 5 attendees
- **Target**: Users within 400m who haven't joined yet
- **Message**: "This Crowd is poppin off! Drop everything and pull up üî•"
- **Smart filtering**: Excludes current attendees from notifications

**Technical Details**:
- Triggered on `signals/{signalId}` document creation
- Counts total signals for event
- Queries both `events` and `userEvents` collections
- Geohash-based proximity filtering

### 5. ‚úÖ Scheduled Notifications

**Study Session Reminder**:
- **Schedule**: 12pm and 3pm daily (Chicago time)
- **Message**: "Turn your study session into a vibe üìö"
- **Body**: "Start a crowd. Someone's always down to link."

**Social Link Reminder**:
- **Schedule**: 7:30pm and 10pm daily (Chicago time)
- **Message**: "Start a crowd üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üíã"
- **Body**: "Someone's always down to link."

Both use Firebase Pub/Sub scheduled functions with cron syntax and Chicago timezone.

### 6. ‚úÖ Client Notification Handling
**Files**: 
- `Crowd/Services/NotificationService.swift`
- `Crowd/Features/EventDetail/EventDetailSheet.swift`
- `Crowd/Features/Home/CrowdHomeView.swift`

**Navigation System**:
- **Event notifications**: Post `navigateToEventFromNotification` notification
- **Promotional notifications**: Post `showHostSheetFromNotification` notification
- **Deep linking**: Automatically find and display event detail sheets
- **Fallback**: Reload events if local data doesn't contain event

**Features**:
- Tap notification ‚Üí Navigate to event detail
- Promotional notification ‚Üí Open host sheet
- Smart event lookup across all event arrays
- Automatic data refresh if event not found locally

## Notification Types Summary

| Type | Trigger | Cooldown | Message Format |
|------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Proximity** | Event created within 400m | 3 hours | "{Interest} Crowd has spawned nearby üìçüéâ" |
| **Engagement** | Event reaches 5 attendees | None | "This Crowd is poppin off! Drop everything and pull up üî•" |

## Deployment Instructions

### Deploy Cloud Functions
```bash
cd functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Testing Checklist

### Proximity Notifications
- [ ] Create event within 400m of user
- [ ] Verify 3-hour cooldown works
- [ ] Verify interest/tag matching
- [ ] Verify emoji appears in notification

### Engagement Notifications
- [ ] Create event with 4 attendees
- [ ] Add 5th attendee (trigger notification)
- [ ] Verify only non-attendees receive notification
- [ ] Verify 400m radius filtering

### Scheduled Notifications

- [ ] Test social reminder (7:30pm/10pm)
- [ ] Or use Firebase Emulator to manually trigger

### Client Notification Handling
- [ ] Tap notification ‚Üí Navigate to event
- [ ] Verify event detail sheet opens
- [ ] Test promotional notification ‚Üí Host sheet

## Key Files Modified
