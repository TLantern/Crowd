# Profile Fixes - October 28, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Image Compression/Quality Issue ✅
**Problem:** Profile image appeared compressed and low quality on the profile view.

**Root Cause:** 
- Using `.scaledToFill()` instead of `.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)`
- Small frame size (90x90) making quality issues more visible

**Solution:**
- Changed from `.scaledToFill()` to `.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)` in `ProfileView.swift`
- This maintains the aspect ratio properly without distortion

**Files Modified:**
- `Crowd/Features/Profile/ProfileView.swift` (line 115)

### 2. Interests Not Showing on Profile ✅
**Problem:** Selected interests from onboarding were not displaying in the interests row on the profile.

**Root Cause:** 
The interest names in the onboarding flow (`InterestsView.swift`) didn't match the interest names in the `Interest.allInterests` array. When the profile loaded, it tried to convert interest strings back to Interest objects by matching names, but couldn't find matches.

**Examples of mismatches:**
- Onboarding: "AI & Tech" → Interest.allInterests: "AI" ❌
- Onboarding: "Gym Life" → Interest.allInterests: "Gym" ❌
- Onboarding: "Business" → Interest.allInterests: Not present ❌
- Onboarding: "Investing" → Interest.allInterests: Not present ❌
- Onboarding: "Esports" → Interest.allInterests: Not present ❌

**Solution:**
- Updated `Interest.allInterests` array to exactly match the interest names used in the onboarding flow
- Now when profile loads, it can properly convert interest strings to Interest objects

**Files Modified:**
- `Crowd/Models/Interest.swift` (lines 25-89)

### 3. Local Profile Image Loading Enhancement ✅
**Problem:** Profile images saved locally weren't loading properly.

**Root Cause:**
- The `loadProfileImage(from:)` method only supported remote URLs via `URLSession`
- Local file:// URLs need to be loaded using `Data(contentsOf:)` instead

**Solution:**
- Updated `loadProfileImage(from:)` to check URL scheme
- For `file://` URLs: Load using `Data(contentsOf:)`
- For remote URLs: Load using `URLSession.shared.data(from:)`
- Added fallback to load from local storage if no URL exists in Firebase

**Files Modified:**
- `Crowd/Features/Profile/ProfileViewModel.swift` (lines 215-241, 267-276)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Profile image displays at full quality without compression
- [ ] Interests selected during onboarding appear on profile
- [ ] Profile image loads from local storage correctly
- [ ] Profile image persists across app restarts
- [ ] Interest tags display with correct emojis
- [ ] Edit mode allows changing interests
- [ ] Profile changes save correctly to Firebase

## Technical Notes

### Profile Image Flow:
1. User selects image → ImageCropper crops it → Saved locally to `Documents/ProfileImages/{userId}.jpg`
2. Local file URL (`file://...`) saved to Firestore as `profileImageURL`
3. Profile loads → Checks if URL is local → Loads from file system
4. Image displayed at 90x90 with `.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)`

### Interest Matching Flow:
1. User selects interests during onboarding (e.g., "AI & Tech", "Coding", "Business")
2. Interest names saved as string array to Firestore
3. Profile loads → Converts strings to Interest objects using `Interest.allInterests.first { $0.name == interestName }`
4. Now properly matches because names are identical

## Future Improvements

- Consider increasing profile image size for better quality (e.g., 120x120)
- Add image caching to improve load times
- Consider compression settings (currently 0.8 quality)
- Add placeholder/loading state for profile images
