## 🔧 What Was Built

### **1. iOS Client Code (Complete ✅)**

#### **Services:**
- ✅ `NotificationService.swift` - FCM token management, delegates, notification handling
- ✅ `LocationService.swift` - Always authorization, location → Firestore sync with geohash
- ✅ `UserProfileService.swift` - Parse FCM tokens and location from Firestore

#### **App Integration:**
- ✅ `AppDelegate.swift` - System-level notification callbacks for APNs
- ✅ `CrowdApp.swift` - Initializes notifications on app launch
- ✅ `AppState.swift` - Monitors location, saves to Firestore every 5 minutes

#### **Data Models:**
- ✅ `UserProfile.swift` - Added `fcmToken`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `geohash` fields
- ✅ `CLLocationCoordinate2D+Geohash.swift` - Geohash calculation utility

#### **Event Creation:**
- ✅ `FirebaseEventRepository.swift` - Events include geohash and category
- ✅ `HostEventSheet.swift` - Captures event category from user

---

### **2. Firebase Cloud Functions (Complete ✅)**

#### **Files Created:**
- ✅ `functions/index.js` - Two cloud functions:
  - `notifyNearbyUsers` - Automatic notifications when events created
  - `testNotification` - Manual testing function
- ✅ `functions/package.json` - Dependencies configuration
- ✅ `firebase.json` - Firebase configuration
- ✅ `.firebaserc` - Project configuration

#### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **Distance Filtering:** Only users within 400m receive notifications
- ✅ **Interest Matching:** Only users whose interests include the event category
- ✅ **APNs Compliance:** Follows Apple's Remote Notification Server guidelines
- ✅ **Token Cleanup:** Automatically removes invalid FCM tokens
- ✅ **Detailed Logging:** Debug-friendly console logs

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Step 1: User Onboarding**
User selects interests during signup:
```
User Profile:
  - displayName: "John Doe"
  - interests: ["Party", "Coffee/Hangout", "Music"]  ← Selected during onboarding
  - fcmToken: "fcm_abc123..."
  - location: GeoPoint(33.2099, -97.1515)
  - geohash: "9vg4hg"
```

### **Step 2: Location Tracking**
App automatically:
- Requests location permission
- Tracks user location in background
- Saves location + geohash to Firestore every 5 minutes

### **Step 3: Event Creation**
When someone creates an event:
```
Event:
  - title: "Coffee Meetup"
  - category: "Coffee/Hangout"  ← Must match user interest
  - latitude: 33.2099
  - longitude: -97.1515
  - geohash: "9vg4hg"
```

### **Step 4: Cloud Function Triggers**
Firebase automatically:
1. Queries users with similar geohash (within ~600m)
2. Filters by exact distance (≤400m)
3. Checks if event category matches user interests
4. Sends push notification to qualified users

### **Step 5: User Receives Notification**
```
Notification:
  Title: "🔥 New Coffee/Hangout near you!"
  Body: "Coffee Meetup at University Union"
```

## ⚠️ Manual Steps Required

The code is complete, but you need to configure the external services:

### **STEP 1: Add Location Permissions to Info.plist**
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE
**Time Required:** 2 minutes

In Xcode:
1. Select project → Crowd target → Info tab
2. Add 3 location permission strings (see detailed guide in previous message)

**Why:** iOS requires permission descriptions or app will crash

---

### **STEP 2: Enable Xcode Capabilities**
**Status:** ❓ UNKNOWN
**Time Required:** 1 minute

1. Go to Signing & Capabilities tab
2. Add "Push Notifications" capability
3. Add "Background Modes" → check "Remote notifications"

**Why:** Tells iOS your app needs push notifications

---

### **STEP 3: Get APNs Key from Apple**
**Status:** ❓ MAY BE DONE
**Time Required:** 3 minutes

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list
2. Create/download APNs Authentication Key (.p8 file)
3. Note the Key ID and Team ID

**Why:** Firebase needs this to send iOS notifications

---

### **STEP 4: Upload APNs Key to Firebase**
**Status:** ❓ MAY BE DONE
**Time Required:** 2 minutes

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Project Settings → Cloud Messaging tab
3. Upload .p8 file + enter Key ID and Team ID

**Why:** Connects Apple's system to Firebase

---

### **STEP 5: Deploy Cloud Functions**
**Status:** ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
**Time Required:** 2 minutes

Run in terminal:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\toluf\OneDrive\Desktop\Crowd
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Why:** Uploads the backend code to Firebase servers

---

### **STEP 6: Test on Physical iPhone**
**Status:** ❌ NOT TESTED
**Time Required:** 5 minutes

1. Build app on real iPhone (not simulator)
2. Grant notification + location permissions
3. Select interests during onboarding
4. Create a test event
5. Verify notification received

**Why:** Simulators don't support push notifications

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Test 1: Interest Match ✅**
- User interests: `["Coffee/Hangout"]`
- Event category: `"Coffee/Hangout"`
- Distance: 200m
- **Expected:** ✅ User receives notification

### **Test 2: No Interest Match ❌**
- User interests: `["Study Session"]`
- Event category: `"Party"`
- Distance: 150m
- **Expected:** ❌ User does NOT receive notification

### **Test 3: Too Far ❌**
- User interests: `["Party"]`
- Event category: `"Party"`
- Distance: 500m
- **Expected:** ❌ User does NOT receive notification (>400m)

## 📊 Verification

### **Check FCM Token Saved:**
Firebase Console → Firestore → `users` → [your user ID]
```json
{
  "fcmToken": "dABC123...",  // ← Should exist
  "location": GeoPoint(33.2099, -97.1515),  // ← Should exist
  "geohash": "9vg4hg",  // ← Should exist
  "interests": ["Party", "Coffee/Hangout"]  // ← From onboarding
}
```

### **Check Event Has Geohash:**
Firebase Console → Firestore → `events` → [event ID]
```json
{
  "title": "Coffee Meetup",
  "category": "Coffee/Hangout",  // ← Must exist
  "geohash": "9vg4hg",  // ← Must exist
  "latitude": 33.2099,
  "longitude": -97.1515
}
```

### **Check Cloud Function Logs:**
Firebase Console → Functions → Logs
```
🎉 New event created: Coffee Meetup
📍 Found 2 users with similar geohash
📏 John Doe: 200m away
✅ John Doe qualifies (200m, interested in Coffee/Hangout)
📬 Sending to 1 user(s)
✅ Successfully sent: 1 notification(s)
```

5. **Merge to main** (after testing confirms everything works)

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Test with 2 devices:** One to create events, one to receive notifications
- **Check Xcode console:** Look for "✅ NotificationService: FCM token saved"
- **Check Firebase logs:** Functions → Logs to see notification triggers
- **Distance matters:** Must be within 400 meters
- **Interests matter:** Event category must match user interests

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **No FCM token saved?**
- Check Xcode console for errors
- Ensure on physical device (not simulator)
- Grant notification permissions

### **No location saved?**
- Grant "Always" location permission
- Check Settings → Crowd → Location → "Always Allow"

### **Cloud function not triggering?**
- Verify functions deployed: `firebase functions:list`
- Check event has `geohash` field in Firestore
- Check Firebase Functions logs for errors

### **Notification not received?**
- User within 400m? Check distance
- Event category matches user interests?
- FCM token valid in Firestore?
- APNs key uploaded to Firebase?
