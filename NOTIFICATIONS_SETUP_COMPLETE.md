## üîß What Was Built

### **1. iOS Client Code (Complete ‚úÖ)**

#### **Services:**
- ‚úÖ `NotificationService.swift` - FCM token management, delegates, notification handling
- ‚úÖ `LocationService.swift` - Always authorization, location ‚Üí Firestore sync with geohash
- ‚úÖ `UserProfileService.swift` - Parse FCM tokens and location from Firestore

#### **App Integration:**
- ‚úÖ `AppDelegate.swift` - System-level notification callbacks for APNs
- ‚úÖ `CrowdApp.swift` - Initializes notifications on app launch
- ‚úÖ `AppState.swift` - Monitors location, saves to Firestore every 5 minutes

#### **Data Models:**
- ‚úÖ `UserProfile.swift` - Added `fcmToken`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `geohash` fields
- ‚úÖ `CLLocationCoordinate2D+Geohash.swift` - Geohash calculation utility

#### **Event Creation:**
- ‚úÖ `FirebaseEventRepository.swift` - Events include geohash and category
- ‚úÖ `HostEventSheet.swift` - Captures event category from user

---

### **2. Firebase Cloud Functions (Complete ‚úÖ)**

#### **Files Created:**
- ‚úÖ `functions/index.js` - Two cloud functions:
  - `notifyNearbyUsers` - Automatic notifications when events created
  - `testNotification` - Manual testing function
- ‚úÖ `functions/package.json` - Dependencies configuration
- ‚úÖ `firebase.json` - Firebase configuration
- ‚úÖ `.firebaserc` - Project configuration

#### **Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Distance Filtering:** Only users within 400m receive notifications
- ‚úÖ **Interest Matching:** Only users whose interests include the event category
- ‚úÖ **APNs Compliance:** Follows Apple's Remote Notification Server guidelines
- ‚úÖ **Token Cleanup:** Automatically removes invalid FCM tokens
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Logging:** Debug-friendly console logs

---

## üéØ How It Works

### **Step 1: User Onboarding**
User selects interests during signup:
```
User Profile:
  - displayName: "John Doe"
  - interests: ["Party", "Coffee/Hangout", "Music"]  ‚Üê Selected during onboarding
  - fcmToken: "fcm_abc123..."
  - location: GeoPoint(33.2099, -97.1515)
  - geohash: "9vg4hg"
```

### **Step 2: Location Tracking**
App automatically:
- Requests location permission
- Tracks user location in background
- Saves location + geohash to Firestore every 5 minutes

### **Step 3: Event Creation**
When someone creates an event:
```
Event:
  - title: "Coffee Meetup"
  - category: "Coffee/Hangout"  ‚Üê Must match user interest
  - latitude: 33.2099
  - longitude: -97.1515
  - geohash: "9vg4hg"
```

### **Step 4: Cloud Function Triggers**
Firebase automatically:
1. Queries users with similar geohash (within ~600m)
2. Filters by exact distance (‚â§400m)
3. Checks if event category matches user interests
4. Sends push notification to qualified users

### **Step 5: User Receives Notification**
```
Notification:
  Title: "üî• New Coffee/Hangout near you!"
  Body: "Coffee Meetup at University Union"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Steps Required

The code is complete, but you need to configure the external services:

### **STEP 1: Add Location Permissions to Info.plist**
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT DONE
**Time Required:** 2 minutes

**Why:** iOS requires permission descriptions or app will crash

#### **Method A: Using Xcode UI (Recommended)**

1. **Open Xcode** - Double-click `Crowd.xcodeproj`

2. **Navigate to Project Settings**
   - In the left sidebar (Project Navigator), click the very top item: **"Crowd"** (blue icon)
   - You should see "PROJECTS" and "TARGETS" in the main editor

3. **Select Target**
   - Under "TARGETS", click on **"Crowd"**

4. **Go to Info Tab**
   - At the top of the main editor, click the **"Info"** tab
   - You'll see "Custom iOS Target Properties" section

5. **Add First Permission**
   - Hover over any row in the list
   - Click the **"+"** button that appears
   - In the new row's **Key** dropdown, start typing: `Privacy - Location When In Use`
   - Select **"Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description"**
   - In the **Value** field, paste:
     ```
     Crowd uses your location to show nearby events and connect you with people around you.
     ```

6. **Add Second Permission**
   - Click **"+"** again
   - Type: `Privacy - Location Always and When In Use`
   - Select **"Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description"**
   - Value:
     ```
     Crowd needs background location access to notify you about events happening near you, even when the app is closed.
     ```

7. **Add Third Permission**
   - Click **"+"** again
   - Type: `Privacy - Location Always`
   - Select **"Privacy - Location Always Usage Description"**
   - Value:
     ```
     Allow Crowd to access your location in the background to send you notifications about nearby events.
     ```

8. **Save** - Press **Cmd+S**

#### **Method B: Edit as Source Code (Faster if comfortable with XML)**

1. **Right-click on Info.plist** in Xcode
2. Select **"Open As" ‚Üí "Source Code"**
3. Find the closing `</dict>` tag near the bottom
4. **Paste this BEFORE the closing `</dict>` tag:**

```xml
	<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Crowd uses your location to show nearby events and connect you with people around you.</string>
	<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Crowd needs background location access to notify you about events happening near you, even when the app is closed.</string>
	<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Allow Crowd to access your location in the background to send you notifications about nearby events.</string>
```

5. **Right-click Info.plist** again ‚Üí **"Open As" ‚Üí "Property List"** (to go back)
6. **Save** (Cmd+S)

#### **Verify It Worked:**
After adding, you should see three new entries in Info.plist:
- ‚úÖ Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description
- ‚úÖ Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description  
- ‚úÖ Privacy - Location Always Usage Description

---

### **STEP 2: Enable Xcode Capabilities**
**Status:** ‚ùì UNKNOWN
**Time Required:** 1 minute

1. Go to Signing & Capabilities tab
2. Add "Push Notifications" capability
3. Add "Background Modes" ‚Üí check "Remote notifications"

**Why:** Tells iOS your app needs push notifications

---

### **STEP 3: Get APNs Key from Apple**
**Status:** ‚ùì MAY BE DONE
**Time Required:** 3 minutes

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list
2. Create/download APNs Authentication Key (.p8 file)
3. Note the Key ID and Team ID

**Why:** Firebase needs this to send iOS notifications

---

### **STEP 4: Upload APNs Key to Firebase**
**Status:** ‚ùì MAY BE DONE
**Time Required:** 2 minutes

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging tab
3. Upload .p8 file + enter Key ID and Team ID

**Why:** Connects Apple's system to Firebase

---

### **STEP 5: Deploy Cloud Functions**
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED
**Time Required:** 2 minutes

Run in terminal:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\toluf\OneDrive\Desktop\Crowd
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Why:** Uploads the backend code to Firebase servers

---

### **STEP 6: Test on Physical iPhone**
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT TESTED
**Time Required:** 5 minutes

1. Build app on real iPhone (not simulator)
2. Grant notification + location permissions
3. Select interests during onboarding
4. Create a test event
5. Verify notification received

**Why:** Simulators don't support push notifications

## üìä Verification

### **Check FCM Token Saved:**
Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí `users` ‚Üí [your user ID]
```json
{
  "fcmToken": "dABC123...",  // ‚Üê Should exist
  "location": GeoPoint(33.2099, -97.1515),  // ‚Üê Should exist
  "geohash": "9vg4hg",  // ‚Üê Should exist
  "interests": ["Party", "Coffee/Hangout"]  // ‚Üê From onboarding
}
```

### **Check Event Has Geohash:**
Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí `events` ‚Üí [event ID]
```json
{
  "title": "Coffee Meetup",
  "category": "Coffee/Hangout",  // ‚Üê Must exist
  "geohash": "9vg4hg",  // ‚Üê Must exist
  "latitude": 33.2099,
  "longitude": -97.1515
}
```

### **Check Cloud Function Logs:**
Firebase Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Logs
```
üéâ New event created: Coffee Meetup
üìç Found 2 users with similar geohash
üìè John Doe: 200m away
‚úÖ John Doe qualifies (200m, interested in Coffee/Hangout)
üì¨ Sending to 1 user(s)
‚úÖ Successfully sent: 1 notification(s)
```

---

## üí° Tips

- **Test with 2 devices:** One to create events, one to receive notifications
- **Check Xcode console:** Look for "‚úÖ NotificationService: FCM token saved"
- **Check Firebase logs:** Functions ‚Üí Logs to see notification triggers
- **Distance matters:** Must be within 400 meters
- **Interests matter:** Event category must match user interests

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **No FCM token saved?**
- Check Xcode console for errors
- Ensure on physical device (not simulator)
- Grant notification permissions

### **No location saved?**
- Grant "Always" location permission
- Check Settings ‚Üí Crowd ‚Üí Location ‚Üí "Always Allow"

### **Cloud function not triggering?**
- Verify functions deployed: `firebase functions:list`
- Check event has `geohash` field in Firestore
- Check Firebase Functions logs for errors

### **Notification not received?**
- User within 400m? Check distance
- Event category matches user interests?
- FCM token valid in Firestore?
- APNs key uploaded to Firebase?
